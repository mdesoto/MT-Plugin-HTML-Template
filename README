# HTML::Template plug-in for Melody and Movable Type

## Overview

The HTML::Template plug-in for Movable Type allows you to manage HTML::Template
files used by external applications within Movable Type.

By default, Movable Type strips out all template tags that use the 
HTML::Template syntax <TMPL_* NAME=VALUE>. While HTML::Template allows the 
alternative syntax <!-- TMPL_* NAME=VALUE -->, this uses seven more characters 
than the default syntax and is often confused with regular HTML comments. Not
the best solution.

So, this plug-in allows you to come up with your own template tag syntax. After
Movable Type builds a page, but before the page is published to the filesystem, 
this plug-in steps in and swaps your new tag with valid HTML::Template tags.

You can then consume templates with your framework of choice.

## Prerequisites

* Movable Type 5.031 (Earlier versions probably work, but are untested).
* Application that consumes HTML::Template style templates.
